## What i learned from lesson 1
1. CSS Helper classes
i learned that instead of using classes for each distinct element i can instead use **css helper 
classes**.for example if we styling a box instead of using  
```
.box {
    float: left;
    text-align: center;
} 
```
we can instead use *css helper classes like 
```
 .left        { float: left; }
.right       { float: right; }

.text-left   { text-align: left; }
.text-right  { text-align: right; }
.text-center { text-align: center; } 
```
